# AutoViDevSpeech
Welcome! This is the project [AutoViDevSpeech](https://github.com/Xinghua-TAO/AutoVeDv.git), and we are waiting for you!

## Introduction
Interdisciplinary exchange of ideas and tools can accelerate scientific progress.
However, relatively little attention has been paid to how artificial intelligence
and computer vision can facilitate research in social science. Here, we 
present AutoViDevâ€”an automatic video-analysis tool that uses machine learning and 
computer vision to support video-based developmental research. AutoViDev identifies 
full body position estimations in real-time video streams using convolutional pose 
machine-learning algorithms. AutoViDev provides valuable information about a variety 
of behaviors, including gaze direction, facial expressions, posture, locomotion, 
manual actions, and interactions with objects.

Now we added exicting voice recognition function in it! Come and join us!
